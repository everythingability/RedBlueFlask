# RedBlueFlask

This is a simple attempt at a Flask and p5js drawing app, that saves your drawings as points in a SQLite database, and then, 
when you open then, "redraws" them. The plan is to alter the way a drawing can be "redrawn", like the p5js YellowTail example.

It's a bit slow when it saves but it sort of works in theory. You can try a demo here:
